I've decided to start eating more raw foods this spring. I won't go in-depth, but eating raw means you cook nothing beyond 118° (or so).  Once you cook food to a certain point, you lose enzymes and nutrients.  I always want to eat big salads but I never know what kind of dressing to top it with! All of the store-bought junk is filled with sugars and unnecessary fats.  I decided to throw together a fruit dressing!
