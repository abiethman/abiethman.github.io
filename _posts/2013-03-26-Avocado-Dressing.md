I'll be the first to admit that I'm not a salad lover.  This has nothing to do with the fact that I sliced a bit of my thumb off last week while chopping romaine, either!  I'm the type of person who likes savory type recipes.  I eat tons of fruit during the day and sometimes I need something with a kick.  I threw together this salad and was quite happy with the end result!
