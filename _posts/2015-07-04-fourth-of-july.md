This past Fourth of July was really great! My husband and I had bought fireworks in anticipation of showing our oldest daughter, V.  She's never seen fireworks before.  We bought the types you'd think any 2.5 year old kid would like. Fountains mostly. 

That morning we all woke up and start our annual Twilight Zone marathon.  We ate our delicious plant based lunch which consisted of veggie dogs, vegan mac n cheese, BBQ kettle chips etc etc.

It started to get dark outside so we decided to start our firework show.  Little did I know I had bought a few fireworks that were  <i>very very</i> loud. My daughter was so terrified of the loud fireworks she actually bit me.

You can see in the video above how much fun I had :) (in my warrior stance, of course).

I'm really starting to love hollow backs. Now I need to start practicing without a wall.

I also recently found out that I will most likely be teaching a yoga class (my very first!) this Sunday. It'll be a hot vinyasa around 90 minutes long. Come join me!

How did you spend your 4th of July? What were your favorite foods? Do you have any traditions?
