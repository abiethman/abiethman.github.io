During the summer I have a hard time posting recipes! I eat so simply. I love the fresh fruits and veggies that this time of the year offers.  Before I became vegan I would have salads with chicken, fatty dressings and it ended up not being healthy at all!  Once I took all the crap out of my diet, it only left my salads pretty sad. Well, I'm here to tell you I've gotten back into the groove! I have been eating tons of salads!  Check out this ridiculously easy dressing I topped it with
