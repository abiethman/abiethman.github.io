I'll admit I'm a holiday junkie. In the summer I'm thinking about Halloween and November first I'm already thinking of Christmas. Yes... I have already bought a few Christmas gifts for my kids. Yes, I did buy vegan nog the day after Halloween. Oh well.  So it makes sense that I have already baked, and enjoyed Eggless nog cupcakes. If you're a lover of holidays like I am, then I hope you enjoy these cupcakes too... even if it is a <em>little</em> early.

This recipe is a modified <a href="http://ohsheglows.com/2009/05/19/baked-doughnuts-that-will-change-your-world/" target="_blank">Oh She Glows recipe</a>

<strong> Makes 6 cupcakes</strong>

<em>Dry Ingredients</em>
1 Cup All Purpose Flour
1/2 Cup Sugar (I used organic cane, but feel free to try coconut sugar or sugar replacer)
1 1/2 tsp Baking Powder
1/4 tsp Salt
1/4 tsp (scant) Nutmeg
1/4 tsp Cinnamon

<em>Wet Ingredients</em>
3/4 Cup vegan nog soymilk (I used Califia Farms almond milk nog)
1/2 tsp Apple Cider Vinegar (you can substitute this for regular white vinegar)
1/2 tsp Pure Vanilla Extract
Egg Replacer for 1 Egg (If you don’t use egg replacer feel free to use 1 egg)

Icing Glaze:

1/2 cup powdered sugar

1 tbsp vegan nog milk

sprinkle of cinnamon

&nbsp;

<strong>Directions:</strong>

Preheat oven to 350F. Take all the wet ingredients and put in a small pot on the stovetop on low. Whisk ingredients together to blend well. Do not let the mixture get too hot, it should just be warm to the touch. Mix the dry ingredients together in a large bowl. Add the wet to the dry and mix until just incorporated. Do not over mix. Spoon mixture into cupcake pan and cook for 10-12 minutes. Use a toothpick to make sure the batter is cooked through. Top with icing and enjoy!
