####I'm so sick of the "shoulds". 

The things in life we want to do, that will make us better people. The New Years resolutions we always seem to ditch by mid January, or February if we're lucky. The promises we make ourselves but don't keep.

##Why wait until January to make some goals?

Let's start now. We're more likely to see these promises through. Here are a few things I'd like to work on:

####Attend a yoga class 2x a week
####Workout 3x a week
####Add leafy greens to each meal
####Update my blog & work on my secret project ;)
####Read two new books a month
####Start a fitness Instagram account!
####Meet up with friends once a month
####Take myself out on a date! Antique stores, lunch, shopping - I spend so much time with my kids this is definitely a must!
####Get some good one on one time with my husband - again, another must.

So, what are some goals you want to achieve for 2016?  Let's make it the best year yet!
