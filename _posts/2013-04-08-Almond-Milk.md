Lately I have been on a "make-it-yourself" kick. I love making my own products because I know exactly what's in the item I'm making! This weekend I was inspired to make home made almond milk! It was so much easier than I thought. It had a subtly sweet taste and was seriously delicious.

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">1 1/2 cups of soaked almonds (soak for 8-12 hours)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">6 cups of water</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Directions:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Add all ingredients into a high-speed blender.  Use a cheese cloth or nut milk bag to extract the almond pulp from the mixture.  I put cheese cloth in a 4 cup measuring cup and poured the milk inside. Squeeze all of the milk through and the pulp will be left over!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Do a google search for almond pulp recipes! I'm going to use mine for an almond - date - chocolate cookie recipe :)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I hope you find the courage to make your own almond milk! Enjoy.</p>
