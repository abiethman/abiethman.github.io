<p style="text-align: center;">Let's face it, we all have sweet cravings.  Most of the time we can eat a piece of fruit and get over it, but other times you just can't shake it!  When my good friend, Jen and I would get together we would make cookie dough and eat it while hanging out.  The recipe below is a good way to get your fix without breaking your diet!</p>
