<p style="text-align: center;">Where in the world have I been?  It's been months since I've had regular posts. So much has been happening in my world!  I'm not even sure where to begin.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This fall Tyler and I decided that we wanted to buy our first home.  If you've ever bought/built a home you know grueling the process can be.  We did a bit of searching online and found a house that was being built and was pretty bare bones.  It was in a great up-and-coming neighborhood.  It was also located in one of the best school districts in Missouri.  We decided to buy!  Buying a house that's in the process of being built is an amazing experience.  Tyler and I got to pick out almost everything!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Our home, sans shutters.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">But the room that matters most to me. Our kitchen!!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Okay, so I'm just a tad obsessed with our new kitchen.  Honestly, if you saw our old kitchen you'd know why I love our new one so much.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">It was perfect timing for us to buy our first house.  In early November we found out we're expecting our second baby girl.  We lived in a two bedroom, two bathroom apartment and it wasn't going to cut it anymore.  Our new house is 4 bedroom, three bathrooms.  Perfect!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Baby Biethman. We couldn't be more excited!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">25 weeks pregnant in the new bathroom (after a work out ;) )</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Needless to say I've been pretty busy putting the baby's bedroom together.  She already has so many clothes.</p>

This past Friday I also celebrated my twenty-fifth birthday.  It was amazing! I got a new bike, some goodies and a Garmin watch.  I've been dying for a bike for a while now and my husband bought me one! I can't wait to get cycling to stay in shape for labor.

Okay, so I know this has been a pretty lengthy update.  My intentions are to be better at updating from here on out.  And now... for the gluten-free pizza crust!
