Where in the world have I been?  It's been months since I've had regular posts. So much has been happening in my world!  I'm not even sure where to begin.

This fall Tyler and I decided that we wanted to buy our first home.  If you've ever bought/built a home you know grueling the process can be.  We did a bit of searching online and found a house that was being built and was pretty bare bones.  It was in a great up-and-coming neighborhood.  It was also located in one of the best school districts in Missouri.  We decided to buy!  Buying a house that's in the process of being built is an amazing experience.  Tyler and I got to pick out almost everything!

####Our home, sans shutters.

But the room that matters most to me. Our kitchen!!

Okay, so I'm just a tad obsessed with our new kitchen.  Honestly, if you saw our old kitchen you'd know why I love our new one so much.
It was perfect timing for us to buy our first house.  In early November we found out we're expecting our second baby girl.  We lived in a two bedroom, two bathroom apartment and it wasn't going to cut it anymore.  Our new house is four bedroom, three bathrooms.  Perfect!

####25 weeks pregnant in the new bathroom (after a work out ;) )


Needless to say I've been pretty busy putting the baby's bedroom together.  She already has so many clothes.

This past Friday I also celebrated my twenty-fifth birthday.  It was amazing! I got a new bike, some goodies and a Garmin watch.  I've been dying for a bike for a while now and my husband bought me one! I can't wait to get cycling to stay in shape for labor.

Okay, so I know this has been a pretty lengthy update.  My intentions are to be better at updating from here on out.  And now... for the gluten-free pizza crust!
