<p style="text-align: center;">I can't take credit for this recipe. I found it on<a href="http://www.therawtarian.com/raw-brownie-recipe" target="_blank"> Laura-Jane (aka The Rawtarian)'s</a> website! Â I've been doing a lot of research on raw food and her website rocks! Check out these super easy &amp; delicious brownies I made today. Note, when I made my brownies I probably could have processed them a tad bit longer so there wouldn't be as many chunky nuts in there.</p>

<center><img src="http://i1208.photobucket.com/albums/cc370/apegg23/P1010205.jpg" alt="" /></center><center><strong>Ingredients:</strong></center>&nbsp;

<center>1 cup pecans (you can use walnuts in a pinch, but pecans are much better!)</center>
<p style="text-align: center;">1 cup dates</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">5 tablespoons raw cacao (cocoa) powder</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">4 tablespoons shredded unsweetened coconut</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">2 tablespoons honey or agave nectar</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">1/4 teaspoon sea salt (I omitted this)</p>

<center><strong>Directions:</strong></center><center>"Place pecans alone in your food processor and process until the pecans become small and crumbly.</center>
<p style="text-align: center;">2. Add dates to the raw brownie recipe and process again until the mixture sticks together and the dates are well processed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">3. Add the remaining ingredients to this raw brownie recipe and process again until the mixture turns a lovely dark chocolatey brown. Stop processing before it gets too buttery. (There should still be air between the small bits so that you will be able to press them down into your brownie pan.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">4. Dump the mixture into a brownie dish or small cake pan and press down firmly using your clean hands.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">5. Refrigerate this raw brownie recipe for a couple of hours. You do not have to refrigerate it, but it is much easier to slice when chilled. By the way, this is actually a raw brownie recipe that keeps its shape! So it can be good for serving to non-raw fooders because the presentation of this raw brownie recipe is good when chilled.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">6. Store this raw brownie recipe in the refrigerator if it lasts that long!"</p>
