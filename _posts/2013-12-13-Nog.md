But sometimes I want an even healthier version. A version I make myself (which totally rocks!) Â Even though the ingredients seem incredibly simple, it tastes just like nog! It has a smooth consistency and has the great holiday spice taste.</p>

1/2 cup milk alternative. I used organic soy, but almond, coconut or hemp would work.
1/2 cup coconut water
1/4 tsp cinnamon
1/8 tsp clove &amp; nutmeg
1/4 tsp pure vanilla extract or a raw vanilla powder
A dash of coconut sugar, or 3-5 dates
