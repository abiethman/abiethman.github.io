Before I became vegan, I used to love eggnog. If you go to the store, you can find many vegan "nogs". They are pretty good! But sometimes I want an even healthier version. A version I make myself (which totally rocks!) Â Even though the ingredients seem incredibly simple, it tastes just like nog! It has a smooth consistency and has the great holiday spice taste.

## Ingredients:
* 3 large bananas
* 1/2 cup milk alternative. I used organic soy, but almond, coconut or hemp would work.
* 1/2 cup coconut water
* 1/4 tsp cinnamon
* 1/8 tsp clove &amp; nutmeg
* 1/4 tsp pure vanilla extract or a raw vanilla powder
* A dash of coconut sugar, or 3-5 dates

## Directions:
Blend all ingredients until smooth and enjoy!
