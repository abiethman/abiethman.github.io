<p style="text-align: center;">Ahh, fall is finally here! I'm sipping on a warm pumpkin spice latte as I type. During the fall, I get inspired to bake and make amazing food. Since it's still a little warm in Kansas (85 today!) I decided to opt for the no-bake delicious dessert. It tastes like fall in a bite! It only takes a few minutes to whip up, too :) These are sweet, but have protein and healthy fats to keep you full and satisfied.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">1-1.5 cup of pecans</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">2 cups of pitted dates</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">1/4 cup of oats</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">1-2 TBL water</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Cinnamon, Clove, &amp; Ginger (just a pinch!)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Directions:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Add pecans, dates, oats and spices (add as much or as little as you like) to your food processor. Once the dates and nuts are in smaller bits, add the water to make it sticky and mix until there is a sticky texture. Form into balls. Eat or refrigerate and enjoy!</p>
