Kale has become so popular lately, it's crazy! Anytime you go to a food enthusiasts website you'd be pretty hard pressed to not find a kale chip recipe. I know there are tons out there, but I made some raw kale chips that totally rock! They remind me of the expensive $7 bag that you'd find at your local health food store.  I made mine raw, but you can definitely pop these in the oven if you'd like.

####Look at these beauties! These chips are packed full of flavor!

##Ingredients:
* 8 cups of kale
* 1 cup of sunflower seeds
* 1 large red bell pepper
* 2 teaspoons of cumin
* 2 teaspoons of garlic powder
* 1 teaspoon of cayenne

##Directions:
* Soak the seeds for about an hour. Wash and de-stem the kale. Wash red bell pepper and clean the seeds out.  Blend red pepper, sunflower seeds &amp; spices together to get a nice thick paste.  Add to kale and massage it to make sure you get the mixture over all of it.  Dehydrate on 115 for 24 hours or bake on 300 for 25 minutes or until kale is crispy.
