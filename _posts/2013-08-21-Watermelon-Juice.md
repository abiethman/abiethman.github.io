<p style="text-align: center;">Summer is winding down.  Kids are back in school.  But, it's still pretty hot outside and it's still watermelon season! Before the leaves turn brown, and chili is in season... grab yourself a glass of this watermelon juice.  Not only will it help you slim down, but it's hydrating and <em>amazingly</em> delicious!</p>
