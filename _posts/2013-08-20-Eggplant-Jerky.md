<p style="text-align: center;">I finally, finally, <em>finally </em>bought a nice dehydrator.  I bought the excalibur 4 tray.  I used to have one of the crappy, cheap-o, thirty dollar dehydrators and it crapped out on me when I dehydrated something longer than a few hours.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">When I was little, I can remember my dad making beef jerky in his dehydrator (which he still does, to this day!) As a vegan you must find creative ways to make the foods you once loved.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Admittedly, I've never cared for eggplant. When it comes to cooking I get these ideas that I can't shake.  When something sounds like a good idea, I just have to try it out.  This is how the eggplant jerky was born.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">1-2 eggplants (or as many as you'd like)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">1/2 - 1 cup Nama Shoyu or Soy sauce. Try a low sodium version.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Garlic Powder</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Onion Powder</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Directions:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Wash, and slice the eggplant.  Put the eggplant in a Ziploc bag, or a bowl large enough to marinade in.  Add the soy sauce or nama shoyu.  Put enough in there so the eggplant can soak it up.  Let the eggplant marinade for 3-4 hours.  Once marinated, place eggplant sliced on the dehydrator trays. Sprinkle with garlic and onion powder.  Dehydrate for 24 hours on 115 degrees.  Once fully dehydrated, place in an air tight container.</p>
