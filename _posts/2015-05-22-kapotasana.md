####I really really love backbends.
They make me feel so good.  I can't say for sure why, maybe it's my overly big boobs (which make me slouch, somtimes) or because it's such a challenge.

####Acording to the interwebs the benefits of kapotasana are:
* The pose stretches your torso and strengthens the core.
* It works the deep hip flexors.
* It strengthens the lower back muscles.
* It realigns the spine and improves posture.

A couple of warm up poses
