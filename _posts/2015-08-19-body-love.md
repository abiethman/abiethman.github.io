Most women, (and men for that matter) want to change something about their bodies.  We're always told we need to be this thin or have hair like this, have a large butt or a big bust.  It's so hard to break free of feeling inadequate. Since January of this year I've lost about 10-15 pounds and I still feel this way.

I have the most wonderful vacation coming up in October and I want to be as fit as possible for it.  I feel as women we put way too much pressure on ourselves. Today I woke up with a new attitude towards it, however.  Maybe it was the dream I had last night.  In my dream I was 80 pounds and I still wasn't happy with my appearance. How jacked up is that? I never want to be that way.

Once we love ourselves, for who we are and for exactly where we are we can begin to grow in healthy ways ( <a href="http://ctt.ec/72ySZ" target="_blank">Tweet this</a> ). Start thinking of things you're grateful your body can accomplish! Just last week I ran 30+ miles. How amazing is that? I can do yoga when I want.  I can chase after my sweet babies. I can put my body "through the ringer" and my heart still beats and my body keeps me alive.

Since we are so close to fall, a time of transition I am transitioning away from bad habits and focusing on nourishing and taking care of my body, mind, & soul.  It's going to kick off with a cleanse.  Not a fad cleanse where all you eat is juice for a week and return to your old habits.  No, this will begin with eating whole foods. Making my own rules when it comes to my diet. Indulging in treats instead of devouring them entirely and then being upset (like that sweet pumpkin spice cinnamon roll I made). Practicing yoga, whether that be at home, or in my local studio.  Practicing twists, back bending, inversions and pranayama to prepare my body for the winter.  Cleaning out old clutter in my home and smudging (which ive never done before, so excited to try it!) Deep cleaning and preparing my home for winter as well.  When I have a clean house it feels so welcoming and light.  Having my windows open to clear out the old stuffy air is so blissful.  And to finish it all of completing my first mala (108 sun salutations) which will be open to the public if you're in the KC area, join us at <a href="http://zenzoneyoga.com/" target="_blank">The Zen Zone</a> Sept 23rd @ 7pm! 

I feel that this will be so nourishing for my body.  I plan on blogging about healthy meals, yoga postures and more in the month of September so stay tuned. If you want to join the fun let me know in the comments below. I'd love to support you in your cleanse!
