<p style="text-align: center;">I love fall &amp; fall foods! Butternut squash soup is no exception. I look forward to making it every year!  It can be a little time consuming to make a batch, so make sure that you have a little bit of time on your hands.</p>

<center><img src="http://i1208.photobucket.com/albums/cc370/apegg23/P1010005_zpsc0b79b06.jpg" alt="" /></center><center><strong>Ingredients:</strong></center><center>1 butternut squash</center><center>4 celery stalks </center><center>4 medium - large carrots </center><center>1 small onion (white or yellow)</center><center>4 cloves of garlic</center><center>2 T olive oil</center><center>32 oz vegetable broth</center><center>2-3 small potatoes (I didn't add potatoes but they would work great in this recipe *optional*)</center><center>1-2 leeks (again, didn't use, but would next time! *optional*)</center>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Directions:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Poke holes all over the butternut squash &amp; microwave for about 10 minutes or until soft</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Once the squash has cooled a tad, you want to skin &amp; cube it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">In a large pot add the olive oil &amp; minced garlic. Cook until the onion is translucent.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Add the rest of the ingredients (make sure veggies are sliced up!) and cook for 25-30 minutes or until the squash is soft.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Once the mixture is thoroughly cooked, add to blender or food processor to get everything pureed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Enjoy!</p>

<center><strong>**Tip**</strong></center><center>Have a plastic bowl ready to throw in all of the "trash" that way you aren't running to the trash can to throw away the extras! (You can see that I did this in the picture above)</center><center></center><center><a class="pin-it-button" href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.andreabiethman%2F2012%2F09%2F21%2Fbutternut-squash-soup%2F&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fi1208.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fcc370%2Fapegg23%2FP1010005_zpsc0b79b06.jpg&amp;description=Yummy%20butternut%20squash%20soup!"><img title="Pin It" src="//assets.pinterest.com/images/PinExt.png" alt="" border="0" /></a></center>
