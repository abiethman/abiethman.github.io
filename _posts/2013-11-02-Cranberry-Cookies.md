Now that my daughter has turned one, gained some teeth and is eating a little more I have to make lots of tasty, simple treats.  I decided to make her banana, oatmeal, cranberry cookie.  With only 5 ingredients I feel pretty good giving these to her!

##Ingredients:
* 2 ripe bananas

In your food processor, blend up your quick oats into small bits
Add your bananas, vanilla, cranberries and cinnamon and blend until smooth

Spoon about 1T dough 1-2" apart
Bake at 350°F for 15-20 minutes or until the cookies are golden and firm.
Cool &amp; serve!
