####Yoga Teacher Training: Day 1

Today is the day I have anticipated for months.  I've been so excited to begin my journey to become a yoga instructor. I was excited to the point of waking up at 4:30 this morning!  My sister in law has come into town to help watch the kids.  

Everything was squared away and I was ready to go.  I have all of my books, my lunch was packed and I was kissing the kids goodbye and headed to the studio.

##All I could think of were excuses NOT to go. To stay in my comfortable little bubble. My zone. 

It feels so good (and sometime bad) to stay in our comfortzone.  I wasn't going to get in my own way of accomplishing goals that I wanted so desperatly for myself.

I thought of how the kids would react. would my sister-in-law take good care of them (of course!)? What if I'm not a good teacher? What if it turns out that I'm no good at it and I fail.

Honestly the only quote that came to mind was "The magic happens outside of your comfortzone". I acknowledged my feelings and got the hell over them. Of course I may still think this from time to time, but I'll never know unless I give it a whole hearted attempt.

Now it's time to go to bed and do it all over again tomorrow.  Honestly I can't wait! It's so incredible to connect with people who are passionate and curious about the same things as I am.
