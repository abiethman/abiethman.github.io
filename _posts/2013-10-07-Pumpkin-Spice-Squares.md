Pumpkin is one of my favorites this time of year. I love adding it to recipes to create a delicious and nutritious fall dish.  This recipe is actually gluten-free, vegan, no-bake AND has no nuts so basically anyone can enjoy.

##Ingredients:
* 1 cup of gluten-free oats
* 25 pitted dates
* 1/4 cup white dried mulberries
* 1/4 cup organic pumpkin pie puree (or homemade puree)
* 1/4 TSP cinnamon
* 1/8 TSP clove
* 1/8 TSP allspice

##Directions:
* Add the oats to your food processor and pulse until the oats are in small bits.  Put the oats in a separate bowl. Then mix up your dates until they are in smaller chunks as well (don't mix too long because then the dates will become buttery) . Once your dates are mixed up add the oats and the rest of the ingredients to the food processor.  Mix thoroughly. Once the mixture is done add it to an 8x4 loaf pan and press so the mixture makes a nice layer. Cut and refrigerate.  Enjoy!
