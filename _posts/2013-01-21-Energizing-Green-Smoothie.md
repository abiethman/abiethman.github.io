I've been going to the gym since late December and I've been looking for something to boost my energy so I can have a great workout. Green smoothies are a great way to get you pumped for a work out! If you're new to green smoothies (which I certainly am) you can start off with more fruits than veggies. Â This recipe not only got me pumped for my workout, it gave me the energy to work harder!
