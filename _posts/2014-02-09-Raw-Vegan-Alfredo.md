I absolutely love when I master a raw recipe. For some reason I have a hard time mastering raw recipes.  Tonight I made a raw alfredo dish that turned out awesome!  The picture quality isn't the greatest, but I snapped a quick picture with my phone :)

## Ingredients:
* 3 large zucchini
* 1/4 - 1/2 cup of macadamia nuts
* Juice from 1/2 lemon
* 1 clove of garlic
* 2 TBL green onion
* A dash of nutmeg
* Salt & pepper to taste
* Cherry tomatoes (optional)

## Directions:
Peel all of the zucchini. In your high speed blender blend one zucchini with the nuts, lemon juice, garlic, onion, and spices. Spiralize the rest of the zucchini and top with alfredo sauce. Top with cherry tomatoes or your favorite herbs and enjoy!
