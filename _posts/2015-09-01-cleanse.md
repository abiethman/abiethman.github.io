I am so excited to be writing this blog post. Today is September first. A time to reflect on our summer so far, and begin to plan our fall.  

####Today I began my cleanse.

Cleaning of the mind, body, and home.

I began with an early morning yoga practice at home. Practicing alone is hard for me to do, but something I deeply want to explore.  I also oil pulled and did some journaling.  If you've never heard of oil pulling I suggest you research it!  It whitens the teeth and rids your mouth of toxins.

I wanted to begin my day this way because being at home with two young kids can be so taxing. It's wonderful to wake up a little bit earlier to get some time for myself.

I want this cleanse to be something that's sustainable. Something that I can do for long term.  For example, switching out refined white sugar to coconut sugar, agave, brown rice syrup.  Eating more whole grains and gluten free foods.  Drinking a little less coffee, more herbal tea.

I think this is something great to do before the holidays as well. Life is all about balance and during the holidays we sometimes indulge too much.  This is like hitting a reset button.

I also began deep cleaning my house today.  I don't want to be overwhelmed, so I started with the master bathroom.  Cleaning out drawers and throwing away things that are used up or expired.  Scrubbing the bath tub, wiping base boards, sweeping, mopping, cleaning grout. I plan to clean one area in the house until it's finished (honestly though, is it ever finished when you have kids?)

Part of the reason I want to deep clean the house is when you have kids, or pets, or a spouse your house gets so messy! Cleaning the house just feels so damn good.  It lets the energy move through freely and it puts you in a better mood.  Once my house is thoroughly cleaned I plan on burning some sage as well.

This past weekend was so much fun. Sunday I met up with some friends and attended an outdoor yoga class. After that I headed over to a tattoo parlor for my scheduled tattoo.  Usually I'm a pretty impulsive person. I've been working on that. But lately I had been wanting a tattoo. I had come to really love the moon phase tattoo idea and couldn't really shake it.  My tattoo artist was amazing, and friendly and the experience couldn't have gone any better.  I also ended up getting it the day after a full super moon. How fitting :)
