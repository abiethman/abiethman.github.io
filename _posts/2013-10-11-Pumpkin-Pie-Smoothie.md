Last year I did a pumpkin smoothie, and it turned out pretty good. But this year I changed a few ingredients and it turned out amazingly well! Â If you're craving pumpkin pie this would be an awesome replacement :)

##Ingredients:
* 6 medium frozen bananas
* 1 cup coconut water
* 1/2 can of organic pumpkin pie puree (to make raw, use a homemade pumpkin puree)
* 2 TBSP coconut sugar OR five pitted dates
* 3-4 cups of water
* Dash of: Cinnamon, Clove, &amp; Nutmeg

##Directions:
Add all ingredients to your blender and blend until smooth. Add more water to have a smoother consistency, and less to have an ice creamy thickness. Enjoy!
