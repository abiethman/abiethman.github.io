After six long weeks post partum, I'm back! Wahoo! During pregnancy (if you're at a healthy weight pre-pregnancy) you're supposed to gain 25-35lbs. This is a huge change for your body! I'm happy to report I've lost almost all of my pregnancy weight.

Being a mom means I have a lot less time to cook elegant meals and I have to count on my easy, delicious, healthy meals.  Since today is meatless Monday I enjoyed roasted brussels sprouts and baby portabellas with flax-seed!
