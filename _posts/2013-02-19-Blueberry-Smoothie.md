<p style="text-align: center;">Lately all you hear is "low-carb" this and "carb-free" that.  Well I'm here to break the news to you. Carbs are good!  Now don't run to the store right now and bulk up on fried foods and candies.  I'm talking about the carbohydrates in fruits.  Carbohydrates are what fuel the body.  Your cells prefer carbs over anything for fuel.  When you eat a high carb meal (fruits) you get instant energy and your mood seems to boost.  More recently I've been eating a lot of fruits and I love the benefits I've been seeing so far.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">My breakfast this morning was a blueberry and banana smoothie</p>
