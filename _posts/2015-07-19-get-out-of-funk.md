This weekend has been a roller coaster ride for sure. Lately I haven't been myself and I can't pinpoint exactly what is causing this feeling.  It really boiled down to the fact that I was stressed.  I've been so insanely busy this summer and I haven't exactly been putting my needs first.  


Taking care of two children (one of which is going through the terrible two's. Can it be over yet?)  is very, very, hard work.  I get overwhelemed with raising kids and taking care of my family which means my creative outlets get put on the back burner. I love to decorate and make my home look beautiful (hello, apartmenttherapy). I love to experiment in the kitchen making vegan goodies. Even blogging is a creative outlet for me.

To cure my creative-less blues I decided to go to downtown Kansas City to hunt down some goodies to decorate my house. I love finding unique scores for dirt cheap.  The antique shop was a fun break, but it was a bust. No goodies to be found.

####I guess I can't say it was a total bust, I mean I did find this.


To cheer myself up I headed to the Farmer's Market so the trip wasn't a complete failure.  Bought some fresh ground coffee, green juice and a vegan breakfast burrito.

As I was driving home I had a biker chick flip me off. I drove home and decided to stay put for the rest of the day.  I even rearranged and redecorated my bedroom to feel more cozier. It really helped get me out of my funk!

So what do you do to get out of a rut? For me, these things helped:
-Chill out. I spend so much of my free time working out or being busy, this is a must

-Drink more water. Trust me.

-Eat healthy. Eating like crap will just add to my stress if I gain 10 pounds

-But not too healty, indulge just a little

-Work out, even if it's a light walk

-Binge on netflix

-Write a blog post :)

-Laugh as much as you can

-Forgive yourself for being crabby

-Paint your nails

-Take a nice bath

-Do yoga, of course

-Spend time with loved ones

####Yoga Updates:
Today is Sunday.  I've taught two hot yoga classes so far.  I can't believe everything is coming together.  I was so nervous for my first class. Believe it or not it was much easier the second time around.  I have a restorative yoga class at The Zen Zone at 10am on August 2nd! Come join me!
