I love this time of year! All types of squash to cook with. Spaghetti squash is really growing on me. I love cooking with seasonal ingredients. Sometimes I just want some low-calorie, healthy pasta.  This is vegan, gluten-free and tasty!  It's so easy to make all you need is a fork and oven :)

##Ingredients:
* Spaghetti squash
* Spaghetti sauce (optional)
* Spices (optional)

##Directions:
* Preheat oven to 375°. Slice the spaghetti squash in half and clean the seeds out. Cook on a cookie sheet for 30 minutes or until tender. Take out the oven. With a fork, scrape down the squash and it will flake up pretty easily. 
####Serve with pasta sauce or with spices! Enjoy.
