Recently I had a request for a spicy dip. Well here it is! I can't get enough of this awesome hummus.  It's very easy to make and goes great with chips, veggies, crackers or on sandwiches.

##Ingredients:
* 3 cups of garbanzo beans (chickpeas)
* 2 TBL of tahini (you can try to leave this out if you want, I haven't made it without it but it'd be worth a shot)
* 2 TBL red wine vinegar
* 1/4 cup of your favorite buffalo sauce
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1/4 teaspoon cayenne powder
* 1/4 teaspoon paprika
* black pepper to taste

##Directions:
* Add all ingredients to your food processor and process until completely smooth.  Add water by the tablespoon if mixture is too thick.

####Andrea's Tips:
* I used dried chickpeas, so if you do too then soak &amp; cook them. I soaked overnight and boiled for one hour.  If you're using canned beans, just rinse and begin recipe.
