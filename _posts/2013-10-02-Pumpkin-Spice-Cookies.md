<p style="text-align: center;">Once in a while I get this "oh crap I haven't made a recipe in forever" panic. This happened yesterday afternoon. I hastily ran to the grocery store to pick up any items I felt inspired by.  Lucky for me, I picked out some pretty awesome things.  I ran up and down the aisles looking for the perfect ingredients and I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004VLV9Q8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004VLV9Q8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=andrbiethealc-20">Millet</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=andrbiethealc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B004VLV9Q8" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> flour.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Once I hurried back home with my newly purchased goodies I thought about what I could do with this millet flour. Turns out I came up empty-handed. I did a quick google search and came across <a href="http://www.sarahbakesgfree.com/2013/09/gluten-free-vegan-pumpkin-chocolate.html" target="_blank">Sarah Bakes Gluten Free Treats</a>.   She had made a chocolate chip pumpkin cookie with millet flour. I decided that was the recipe I'd like to bake.  I changed some of the ingredients (see below) and the recipe turned out fabulous!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Ingredients:</strong>
1 cup <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004VLV9Q8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004VLV9Q8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=andrbiethealc-20">Millet</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=andrbiethealc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B004VLV9Q8" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> flour
3/4 cup certified gluten-free rolled oats, pulsed in blender
1/2 cup organic brown sugar
1/4 cup organic cane sugar
1 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup organic pumpkin pie puree
1/4 cup coconut oil
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
Nuts, chocolate chips, or any topping you might want (optional)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Directions:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Preheat your oven to 375°. Mix dry ingredients. Add the pumpkin puree, vanilla and coconut oil. Mix thoroughly.  Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Make 1-2 TBL balls of cookie dough. Cook for 9-12 minutes or until golden brown. Take them out of the oven and let them cool for 2-3 minutes. Store in an airtight container. Enjoy!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Note: Sometimes we indulge with food. In this recipe I used a healthier oil, all organic, and a gluten free flour. When the holidays roll around you don't always have to say "No" to your favorite foods. Just replace some of the not so great ingredients with  better quality ones if you're going to indulge.</p>
