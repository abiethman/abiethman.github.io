<p style="text-align: center;">I LOVE fall. No joke. I love how everything is pumpkin flavored. I love the change in the weather.  I love the fall cooking.  Before I lost weight, I really enjoyed getting bagels with pumpkin cream cheese.  They would load up the bagel with it at my favorite bagel shop.  I decided to make my own version of it at home and it turned out fabulously!</p>
