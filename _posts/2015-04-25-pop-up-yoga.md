This morning I sat contemplating my quest to join many other Yogis in a Kansas City yoga meetup.  It was raining and the event was to be held outdoors.  I wasn't sure if it was my crabby husband or my squaking kids that eventually sent me off but I made it.

Honestly I wasn't quite sure how the meet up would turn out with all of the rain.  But to my surprise we ended up in a beautiful space in the Kansas City Public Library.  We had a spectacular view of some pretty neat buildings downtown.

We had a very chill practice, and once it was over my yoga bud, Alexiss, and I had some fun playing with a few poses.  Inversions are so much fun!


## Benefits of inversions:
* Builds heat & energizes
* Improves balance
* Increases core strength
