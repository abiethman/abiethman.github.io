<p style="text-align: center;">I'm always looking for tasty healthier versions of the foods I once loved, the food that made me <em>fat. </em> My husband has the most ferocious sweet tooth imaginable.  Today I was throwing around some ideas in my head for an easy vegan dessert (no bake, by the way!) and I came up with this tasty morsel.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Can you guess the main ingredient? :)</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Ingredients you will need:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Approximately 60 dates. I estimate this will be about 2-3 cups.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">2-3 Tablespoons of cocoa, cacao, or carob powder.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">1/4 cup powdered sugar (buy organic to make sure it's vegan).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">2 Tablespoons of water.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Directions:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Place dates, cocoa, and sugar in the food processor. Blend until finely chopped. Add water to make mixture sticky. Put into a container, or pan and refrigerate for 2 hours or until chilled. Enjoy!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>:: Andrea's Tips ::</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">If you want a really smooth fudge, soak your dates for 2-3 hours or until very soft. This will make them much easier to blend, therefore smoother. If you want a chunkier fudge then skip the soaking!</p>
