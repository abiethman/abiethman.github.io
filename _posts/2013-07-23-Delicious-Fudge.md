I'm always looking for tasty healthier versions of the foods I once loved, the food that made me fat.  My husband has the most ferocious sweet tooth imaginable.  Today I was throwing around some ideas in my head for an easy vegan dessert (no bake, by the way!) and I came up with this tasty morsel.

##Ingredients you will need:

* Approximately 60 dates. I estimate this will be about 2-3 cups.
* 2-3 Tablespoons of cocoa, cacao, or carob powder.
* 1/4 cup powdered sugar (buy organic to make sure it's vegan).
* 2 Tablespoons of water.

##Directions:
Place dates, cocoa, and sugar in the food processor. Blend until finely chopped. Add water to make mixture sticky. Put into a container, or pan and refrigerate for 2 hours or until chilled. Enjoy!

####Andrea's Tips
If you want a really smooth fudge, soak your dates for 2-3 hours or until very soft. This will make them much easier to blend, therefore smoother. If you want a chunkier fudge then skip the soaking!
