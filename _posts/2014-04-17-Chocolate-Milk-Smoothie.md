Now, granted you could buy a vegan version of chocolate milk at your grocery store, but some of them are GMO or have a carcinogenic ingredient (carrageenan). Â This simple recipe has only three ingredients.

##Ingredients:
* 10 large medjool dates
* 1 drop of peppermint oil (I used DoTerra. It's very strong, so be sure to only use ONE drop
* 2 t carob or cacao powder
* 3 cups of water
* Ice (optional)

##Directions:
* Place all ingredients into your blender and blend until completely smooth and enjoy!
