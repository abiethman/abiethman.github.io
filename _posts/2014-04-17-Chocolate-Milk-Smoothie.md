<p style="text-align: center;">Ummm....can this be real life? I can make a homemade chocolate milk smoothie easily from home?!  Honestly this isn't my recipe.  I have to give credit to the talented <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLwUd5KtYONsRJ3UAOojZ0w" target="_blank">Freelee the Banana Girl</a>.  I searched her YouTube channel to find the exact recipe and I had a hard time. So, really this is just me taking a stab at what I could remember from her recipe.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Now, granted you could buy a vegan version of chocolate milk at your grocery store, but some of them are GMO or have a carcinogenic ingredient (carrageenan).  This simple recipe has only <strong>three</strong> ingredients.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">-10 large medjool dates</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">-1 drop of peppermint oil (I used DoTerra. It's very strong, so be sure to only use <strong>ONE</strong> drop)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">-2 t carob or cacao powder</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">-3 cups of water</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">-Ice (optional)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Directions:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Place all ingredients into your blender and blend until completely smooth and enjoy!</p>
