Like any health conscious parent, I get a little worried when Halloween rolls around. Violet is almost one and when she's old enough to eat some, I don't want to feed her the crap filled candy that you purchase at the store. I'd rather make a version at home, where I know what ingredients are in the candy! So here's a four ingredient, super easy peanut butter cup candy!

##Ingredients:
* 10-12oz of your favorite chocolate chips. (I used a vegan mini chip)
* 1/2 - 3/4 cup of natural, unsweetened, smooth peanut butter
* 1/4 cup of powdered sugar
* 1 TBL coconut oil
* pinch of sea salt
* 25 mini cupcake liners

##Directions:
In a double boiler or your microwave gently melt the chocolate.  Once the chocolate is completely melted add the coconut oil and stir thoroughly. Put the mini cupcake liners in a 9x13 cake pan.  Once the chocolate mixture is done, put a layer of chocolate in each liner.  Then put the pan in the freezer so the chocolate can freeze.  While the chocolate is getting cold, mix the peanut butter, sugar, and salt (I used my kitchen aid mixer, you could use a hand mixer if you don't have a kitchen aid).  Then add a layer of peanut butter mix to the liners.  Finish off by topping the cups by another layer of chocolate. Let the peanut butter chocolate cups sit in the freezer to harden (5-10 minutes). Store in freezer or refrigerator.  Enjoy!
